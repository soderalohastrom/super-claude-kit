# Context Capsule - Claude Code Usage Guide

## For Claude: How to Use This System Effectively

This guide is specifically for Claude Code (me!) on how to leverage the Context Capsule system to maximize efficiency and context awareness.

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Before re-reading files or re-checking status, check the capsule first!**

The capsule injection appears automatically before each prompt. Use it to:
- Avoid re-reading files I accessed recently
- Remember current task without TodoWrite lookup
- Know git state without running git commands
- Recall sub-agent findings
- Reference discoveries made earlier in session

## 📋 When to Log (Self-Reporting Pattern)

### 1. After Using Read/Edit/Write Tools

**Log file access immediately after tool use:**

```bash
# Just read a file
./.claude/hooks/log-file-access.sh "server/src/main.ts" "read"

# Just edited a file
./.claude/hooks/log-file-access.sh "server/src/auth/auth.service.ts" "edit"

# Just created a new file
./.claude/hooks/log-file-access.sh ".claude/new-hook.sh" "write"
```

**When to log:**
- ✅ After reading important reference files (CLAUDE.md, architecture docs)
- ✅ After editing implementation files
- ✅ After creating new files
- ❌ Skip logging for quick bash outputs or transient reads

### 2. After Sub-Agent Completes

**Log sub-agent results with key findings:**

```bash
# Explore agent found something important
./.claude/hooks/log-subagent.sh "Explore" "Authentication flow in server/src/auth/, uses JWT + Redis"

# Plan agent created implementation strategy
./.claude/hooks/log-subagent.sh "Plan" "5-step plan: schema → API → validation → UI → tests"

# Specialized agent completed analysis
./.claude/hooks/log-subagent.sh "architecture-explorer" "System uses 3-tier agent hierarchy"
```

**When to log:**
- ✅ After Task tool completes with useful findings
- ✅ When sub-agent discovers architecture patterns
- ✅ When sub-agent identifies files/locations
- ❌ Skip if sub-agent didn't find anything useful

### 3. After Key Discoveries

**Log insights, patterns, decisions as I learn:**

```bash
# Discovered a code pattern
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "pattern" "All hooks use 'set -euo pipefail' for safety"

# Had an important realization
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "insight" "TOON format reduces tokens by 52% vs JSON"

# Made a design decision
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "decision" "Using git diff for change detection over timestamps"

# Found architectural detail
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "architecture" "Frontend uses Smart API Client pattern"

# Identified a bug
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "bug" "Session hooks not catching sub-agent completions"

# Found optimization opportunity
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "optimization" "Parallel tool calls reduce latency by 40%"
```

**When to log:**
- ✅ When I understand how something works
- ✅ When I make an important decision
- ✅ When I find a pattern worth remembering
- ✅ When I identify bugs or optimizations
- ❌ Skip obvious/trivial observations

### 4. After TodoWrite Updates

**Sync tasks with capsule:**

```bash
# After using TodoWrite tool, log current state
./.claude/hooks/log-task.sh "in_progress" "Implementing Phase 3 features"
./.claude/hooks/log-task.sh "pending" "Test cross-session persistence"
./.claude/hooks/log-task.sh "completed" "Design automatic discovery extraction"
```

**When to log:**
- ✅ After marking task as in_progress (so capsule shows current work)
- ✅ After completing major tasks
- ❌ Skip for every single todo update (too noisy)

## 🚀 Efficient Workflow Pattern

### Starting a Task

1. **Check capsule** - What's already in context?
2. **Log current task** - Mark it in_progress
3. **Work on task** - Read files, make changes
4. **Log file operations** - Track what I accessed
5. **Log discoveries** - Capture insights as they occur
6. **Complete task** - Log as completed

### Using Sub-Agents

1. **Launch sub-agent** via Task tool
2. **Wait for completion**
3. **Read sub-agent result**
4. **Log key findings** with log-subagent.sh
5. **Continue work** using those findings

### Example Session Flow

```
[Session starts - capsule initializes]

User: "Implement authentication system"

Me:
1. Check capsule → See I'm on epic/auth branch, 5 dirty files
2. Log task → "in_progress|Implementing authentication system"
3. Launch Explore agent to find existing auth code
4. Agent completes → Log: "Explore|Found auth in server/src/auth/"
5. Read auth files → Log file access for each
6. Make discovery → Log: "architecture|Uses JWT + Redis session store"
7. Implement feature → Log edits
8. Complete → Log: "completed|Implementing authentication system"

[Next prompt - capsule shows all this context!]
```

## 💡 Reading the Capsule

When I see the capsule, I should:

**🌿 Git State:**
- Check branch to ensure I'm on correct one
- Note dirty file count (indicates uncommitted work)
- Check ahead/behind to know sync status

**📁 Files in Context:**
- AVOID re-reading files shown here (unless >10m old)
- Use this to build mental model of codebase
- Reference these files when explaining to user

**✅ Current Tasks:**
- Always acknowledge the in_progress task
- Prioritize current task over new work
- Reference completed tasks when explaining progress

**🤖 Sub-Agent Results:**
- Recall findings instead of re-exploring
- Build on previous discoveries
- Avoid duplicate sub-agent calls

**💡 Session Discoveries:**
- Reference these insights in my responses
- Build on patterns discovered
- Maintain consistency with decisions made

**⏱️ Session Info:**
- Note message count (high count = long session)
- Consider session duration for context freshness

## 🎨 Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Log after every major tool use (Read/Edit/Write)
- Capture sub-agent results immediately
- Note architectural discoveries as I learn
- Sync TodoWrite status when changing tasks
- Check capsule before redundant operations
- Log decisions so I remember rationale

### DON'T ❌
- Log trivial operations (quick bash commands)
- Over-log discoveries (keep signal-to-noise high)
- Ignore capsule (defeats the purpose!)
- Re-read files shown in capsule
- Launch duplicate sub-agents
- Forget to log current task status

## 🔄 Self-Correction Pattern

If I realize I should have logged something:

```bash
# Retroactively log file access
./.claude/hooks/log-file-access.sh "path/to/file" "read"

# Capture late discovery
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "insight" "What I just realized"

# Update task status
./.claude/hooks/log-task.sh "in_progress" "Current task"
```

## 📊 Measuring Success

Good capsule usage means:
- **Fewer redundant file reads** - If capsule shows I read it 2m ago, don't read again
- **Better task continuity** - Always see current work without asking
- **Richer context** - User sees my discoveries in capsule
- **Faster responses** - Less time re-gathering context
- **Better memory** - Sub-agent findings persist across messages

## 🎯 Quick Reference

```bash
# File access
./.claude/hooks/log-file-access.sh "<path>" "read|edit|write"

# Sub-agent
./.claude/hooks/log-subagent.sh "<type>" "<summary>"

# Discovery
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "<category>" "<content>"
# Categories: pattern, insight, decision, architecture, bug, optimization

# Task
./.claude/hooks/log-task.sh "<status>" "<content>"
# Status: in_progress, pending, completed
```

## 🚦 When NOT to Use Capsule

- **Very first message** - Capsule might be empty
- **User asks to ignore context** - Respect explicit requests
- **Cross-session work** - Capsule resets each session (until Phase 3)
- **Simple queries** - Quick answers don't need heavy context

## 🎓 Learning from Usage

After each session, reflect:
- Did I avoid redundant file reads?
- Did I remember sub-agent findings?
- Did I maintain task awareness?
- Did I capture key discoveries?
- Did capsule help or was it noise?

Use this reflection to improve logging patterns.

**Remember**: The capsule is my external memory. Trust it, use it, maintain it!

# Super Claude Kit Integration

This project uses **Super Claude Kit** - a persistent context memory system for Claude Code that enables cross-message and cross-session memory.

## 🎯 System Overview

Super Claude Kit provides:
- **Persistent Context**: Remember files accessed, tasks worked on, and discoveries made
- **Smart Refresh**: Automatic context updates before each prompt
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Context persists across sessions (24-hour window)
- **Sub-Agent Tracking**: Remember findings from specialized agents
- **Discovery Logging**: Capture architectural insights and patterns

## 📖 Usage Guide

**CRITICAL**: Read and follow `.claude/docs/CAPSULE_USAGE_GUIDE.md`

### Required Behavior

Claude (you!) MUST follow these patterns:

#### 1. Check Capsule Before Redundant Operations
```
BEFORE re-reading a file → Check if it's in capsule (Files in Context)
BEFORE running git status → Check capsule (Git State)
BEFORE asking about current task → Check capsule (Current Tasks)
```

#### 2. Log After Tool Usage

**After Read/Edit/Write:**
```bash
./.claude/hooks/log-file-access.sh "<path>" "read|edit|write"
```

**After Task Tool (Sub-Agents):**
```bash
./.claude/hooks/log-subagent.sh "<agent-type>" "<summary-of-findings>"
```

**After Discoveries:**
```bash
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "<category>" "<insight>"
# Categories: pattern, insight, decision, architecture, bug, optimization, achievement
```

**After TodoWrite:**
```bash
./.claude/hooks/log-task.sh "<status>" "<task-description>"
# Status: in_progress, pending, completed
```

#### 3. Workflow Pattern

```
1. Check capsule → See current context
2. Log task start → Mark as in_progress
3. Work on task → Read/edit files
4. Log operations → Track file access
5. Log discoveries → Capture insights
6. Complete task → Mark as completed
```

## 🚦 Hooks (Automatic)

These run automatically via `.claude/settings.local.json`:

- **SessionStart**: `session-start.sh` → Initialize capsule, restore previous session
- **UserPromptSubmit**: `pre-task-analysis.sh` → Update capsule with latest changes

## 📊 Verification

Check if Super Claude Kit is working:

```bash
# View current stats
bash .claude/scripts/show-stats.sh

# Test installation
bash .claude/scripts/test-super-claude.sh

# Check logs
ls -la .claude/*.log
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Check capsule before redundant file reads
- Log after every Read/Edit/Write operation
- Capture sub-agent findings immediately
- Note architectural discoveries as you learn
- Reference capsule context in responses

### DON'T ❌
- Ignore the capsule (defeats the purpose!)
- Re-read files shown in capsule (unless stale)
- Launch duplicate sub-agents for same task
- Forget to log important operations
- Over-log trivial operations

## 🎓 Quick Reference

```bash
# File operations
./.claude/hooks/log-file-access.sh "<path>" "read|edit|write"

# Sub-agent results
./.claude/hooks/log-subagent.sh "<type>" "<summary>"

# Discoveries
./.claude/hooks/log-discovery.sh "<category>" "<content>"

# Tasks
./.claude/hooks/log-task.sh "<status>" "<description>"

# View stats
bash .claude/scripts/show-stats.sh
```

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### Progressive Reader
Read large files progressively in semantic chunks using tree-sitter AST parsing.

```bash
# Read first chunk of a large file
progressive-reader --path src/services/auth.service.ts

# List all chunks without content (preview)
progressive-reader --path large-file.py --list

# Read specific chunk by index
progressive-reader --path app.js --chunk 2

# Continue from previous read (uses TOON token)
progressive-reader --continue-file /tmp/continue.toon

# Adjust chunk size
progressive-reader --path big-file.go --max-tokens 4000
```

**When to use**:
- Files > 50KB that would consume too much context
- Reading sub-agent outputs progressively
- Large codebase exploration with minimal context usage
- Managing TPM rate limits

**Supported languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go

### Dependency Analysis Tools
Tools for analyzing code dependencies (requires dependency graph):

```bash
# Query dependencies for a file
.claude/tools/query-deps/query-deps.sh src/auth.ts

# Analyze impact of changes
.claude/tools/impact-analysis/impact-analysis.sh src/database.ts

# Find circular dependencies
.claude/tools/find-circular/find-circular.sh

# Find dead code (unused files)
.claude/tools/find-dead-code/find-dead-code.sh
```
